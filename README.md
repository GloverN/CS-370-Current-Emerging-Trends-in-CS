# Portfolio Reflection
I was given the framework for an intelligent pirate agent that would train to play the game Treasure Hunt. I was given all the code except for the Q-Training algorithm which I needed to write myself.
Computer scientists are primarily problem solvers. They use code and programatic thinking to solve various problem that may arise in their fields or industries. The modern world essentially runs on computers, so the services that computer scientists provide and the problems they solve are essential to keeping things running smoothly.
I approach problems as things to be broken down. Each problem is something that can be broken down into a series of small issues that are far more easily approached. I would then solve those issues one-by-one until I've solved the problem as a whole.
My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist are to make sure that everything I work on is secure and that it follows wthical guidelines. Those ethical guidelines are extremely important, because they ensure that computer scientists consider how their developments and software affect society as a whole. It is my ethical responsibility to make sure anything I work on isn't used to harm or take advantage of people, and to ensure that it's used to better society.
